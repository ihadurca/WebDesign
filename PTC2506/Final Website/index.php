<div class='contenttop'>The Introduction!</div>
The Internet, we all use it, some of us spend far too much time on it. Presenting the idea that the internet has a culture is not frightfully difficult. Some use it as a means to obtain information, sometimes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing" target="_new">terrifying</a> extremes. It can be a scary place, but that is in the tradition of an open& anonymous environment.

There is no real way to encompass the entirety of the culture created by the internet in a single page. Like the internet, its culture is organic and continues to evolve. Rendering any attempt futile and dated.<br>
Instead, I offer you a few select pages in the hope that you will grasp it a little. I offer a selection of <a href="ragefaces.php">Rage Faces</a>, a copy of the <a href="rules.php">Rules of the Internet</a>, and a fun little bit of java that shows a <a href="liveredditfeed.php">live feed of reddit</a>.

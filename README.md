WebDesign
=========
This is the file repository I have created for the webpages to be created for PTC 2506 Summer 2012 at Montana Tech.

This is a STUDENT project, use at your own risk.

To use in the Mac lab
1. Download sourcetree (Don't worry its free) http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
2. Git Clone using the git address. https://ihadurca@github.com/ihadurca/WebDesign.git
3. Update files, commit & push back to Git
4. Henceforth "pull" at the beginning of each class & "push" at the end.
